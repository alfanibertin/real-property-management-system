# Property Management System - Wireframe Plan

The system will support the following user roles, each with specific access and functionality:

1. **Property Owner** - Primary user who owns properties and manages them
2. **Tenant** - Rents property and interacts with the system for payments and maintenance requests

## Wireframe Design Approach

The wireframes will be created with the following principles in mind:

1. **Responsive Design** - Layouts will adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
2. **Intuitive Navigation** - Clear navigation structure with logical grouping of features
3. **Consistent Layout** - Maintain consistency across all screens for better user experience
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Present information in a way that minimizes complexity
5. **Accessibility** - Design with accessibility in mind for all users

## Wireframe Tools and Deliverables

The wireframes will be created using a combination of:
- HTML/CSS for interactive prototypes
- Descriptive documentation with layout specifications

Final deliverables will include:
1. Low-fidelity wireframes for all key screens
2. Interactive prototype for core user flows
3. Annotations explaining functionality and interactions
4. Responsive design specifications

## Next Steps

After wireframes are approved:
1. Create high-fidelity UI mockups with color schemes, typography, and visual elements
2. Develop interactive prototypes for user testing
3. Refine designs based on feedback
4. Prepare design assets for frontend development
